1) False

2) - Beam search will run more slowly.
   - Beam search will use up more memory.
   - Beam search will generally find better solutions (i.e. do a better job maximizing P(y|x))

3) True

4) No, because P(y*|x)=P(y^|x) indicates the error should be attributed to the RNN rather than to the search algorithm.

5) True

6) - We expect a<t,t'> to be generally larger for values of a<t'> that are highly relevant to the value the network should output for y<t>. (Note the indices in the superscripts.)
   - ?t'a<t,t'>=1 (Note the summation is over t'.)

7) True

8) The input sequence length Tx is large.

9) cookbook

10) Whether the trigger word is being said at time t.
