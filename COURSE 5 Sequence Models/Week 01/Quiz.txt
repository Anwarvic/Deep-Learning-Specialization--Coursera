1) x^(i)<j>

2) Tx=Ty

3) - Sentiment classification (input a piece of text and output a 0/1 to denote positive or negative sentiment) 
   - Gender recognition from speech (input an audio clip and output a label indicating the speaker’s gender) 

4) Estimating P(y<t>∣y<1>,y<2>,…,y<t−1>)

5) (i) Use the probabilities output by the RNN to pick the highest probability word for that time-step as y^<t>. 
   (ii) Then pass this selected word to the next time-step.
   (wrong)

6) Exploding gradient problem.

7) 100

8) Betty’s model (removing Γr), because if Γu≈0 for a timestep, the gradient can propagate back through that timestep without much decay. 

9) Γu and Γr (wrong)

10) Unidirectional RNN, because the value of y<t> depends only on x<1>,…,x<t>, but not on x<t+1>,…,x<365>
