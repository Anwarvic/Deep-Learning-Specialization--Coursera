# Note:

There is a file called 'glove.6B.50d.txt' which represents the Global Vectors for Word Representations that should be included. But, the size of this file is 167MB, and Github prevents any file whose size is bigger than 100MB.  So, you can download it from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b4c8ujs7nac47p7/glove.6B.50d.txt.tar.gz).
