1) Spend a few days training a basic model and see what mistakes it makes.

2) False

3) 500 images on which the algorithm made a mistake

4) False

5) Choose the training set to be the 900,000 images from the internet along with 80,000 images from your car’s front-facing camera. The 20,000 remaining images will be split equally in dev and test sets.

6) - You have a large avoidable-bias problem because your training error is quite a bit higher than the human-level error.
   - You have a large data-mismatch problem because your model does a lot better on the training-dev set than on the dev set.

7) There’s insufficient information to tell if your friend is right or wrong.

8) True because it is greater than the other error categories added together (8.0 > 4.1+2.2+1.0).

9) 2.2% would be a reasonable estimate of the maximum amount this windshield wiper could improve performance.

10) So long as the synthesized fog looks realistic to the human eye, you can be confident that the synthesized data is accurately capturing the distribution of real foggy images, since human vision is very accurate for the problem you’re solving.

11) - You should also correct the incorrectly labeled data in the test set, so that the dev and test sets continue to come from the same distribution
    - You should not correct incorrectly labeled data in the training set as well so as to avoid your training set now being even more different from your dev set.

12) She should try using weights pre-trained on your dataset, and fine-tuning further with the yellow-light dataset.

13) Neither transfer learning nor multi-task learning seems promising.

14) False

15) Large training set
